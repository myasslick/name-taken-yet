# Design

1. Use Selenium to check if Gmail account name has been taken.
    - We could use telnet to check, but I am afraid IP will be banned by Google.

2. Use YouTube API Search endpoint to fuzzy search channel name/channel title.
    - Not great, but that's the best we can do since most YouTube channels
      are not eligible for getting a custom url (/user/MyCustomURL, or
      /channel/MyCustomURL).

```bash
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&maxResults=5&q=JustTooEasy&type=channel&key={API}
```
